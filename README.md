# animal_shelters_project

This project is aimed to create a search system for finding animals available for adoption in different shelters. It will take the user's likings into consideration and display the available shelters on a map of a given by user region. For more specific information see wiki.

Information about adoptable pets will be taken from the petfinder.com API, which allows to access their database of different shelters by providing an API key. If you want to get yours, please go to https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key.
